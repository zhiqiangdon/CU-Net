## Overview
The follwoing figure gives an illustration of naive dense U-Net, stacked U-Nets and coupled U-Nets (CU-Net). The naive dense U-Net and stacked U-Nets have shortcut connections only inside each U-Net. In contrast, the coupled U-Nets also have connections for semantic blocks across U-Nets. The CU-Net is a hybrid of naive dense U-Net and stacked U-Net, integrating the merits of both dense connectivity, intermediate supervisions and multi-stage top-down and bottom-up refinement. The resulted CU-Net could save ~70% parameters of the previous stacked U-Nets but with comparable accuracy.

If we couple each U-Net pair in multiple U-Nets, the coupling connections would have quadratic growth with respect to the U-Net number. To make the model more parameter efficient, we propose the order-K coupling to trim off the long-distance coupling connections.

For simplicity, each dot represents one U-Net. The red and blue lines are the shortcut connections of inside semantic blocks and outside inputs. Order-0 connectivity (Top) strings U-Nets together only by their inputs and outputs, i.e. stacked U-Nets. Order-1 connectivity (Middle) has shortcut connections for adjacent U-Nets. Similarly, order-2 connectivity (Bottom) has shortcut connections for 3 nearby U-Nets.

### Prerequisites

This package has the following requirements:

* `Python 2.7`
* `Pytorch v0.4.0` or `Pytorch v0.1.12`

Note that the script name with string `prev-version` requires `Pytorch v0.1.12`.

### Training

```
python cu-net.py --gpu_id 0 --exp_id cu-net-2 --layer_num 2 --order 1 --loss_num 2 --is_train true --bs 24
```

### Validation

```
python cu-net.py --gpu_id 0 --exp_id cu-net-2 --layer_num 2 --order 1 --loss_num 2 --resume_prefix your_pretrained_model.pth.tar --is_train false --bs 24
```

### Model Options
```
layer_num     # number of coupled U-Nets
order         # the order of coupling
loss_num      # number of losses. Losses are uniformly distributed along the CU-Net. Each U-Net at most has one loss. (loss_num <= layer_num)
```
